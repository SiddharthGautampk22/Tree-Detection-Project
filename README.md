# Tree-Detection-Project
A deep learning model for detecting different species of trees using images.
In this project, A webapp is created to perform the task of identifying if the uploaded image is that of a tree or not. If not, an error alert box pops up on the screen. The Webapp also allows the users to select a pre trained model on which the predictions will be made on the images uploaded by the user.
A model for detecting if the uploaded image is that of a tree or not is used and another model, to tell different species of trees is used.
There are a lot of pre trained models which can be directly selected and used.
Download the models from this link : https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqWTDtBS6gBLyyQHIsoNlmzlVL8Z?e=cBACsu
Download all the models available and paste them inside the WebApp Folder.
Steps to run the program:-
  1. Download the code.
  2. Open the complete folder in VSCode.
  3. Download and paste all the models from the link inside the WebApp folder.
  4. Open the app.py file and in the VsCode terminal, set the location to WebApp folder and then type the command :- python -m flask run.
